# Intro to Testing Lab

### Part 1
This assignment was an introduction to writing tests. The first test I wrote for this assignment were to check the output of the greet function matches the specific value 'hello world!'

Next I added tests to check that value that are not strings return null.

--That concludes part one of the assignment

### Part 2
The objective for this piece was to write tests for an addition function and a subtraction function.
I started with the tests first and went from there. The tests I wrote were:
First, check the functionality with working numbers. Second, dealing with invalid inputs. All invalid inputs will return null.
