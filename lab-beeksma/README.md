#DeltaV js 401 lab 01 - Testing

This lab contains 3 functions, and tests for each.

arithmetic.js has a add function that should take two number arguments and return the sum of the two, and a sub function, that should take two number arguments and return the difference between the first and the second.

greet.js has a single function greet that should take a single string as and argument and return a string in the form of "Hello <string>".

I am using mocha to test, and tests can be found in test.js.
